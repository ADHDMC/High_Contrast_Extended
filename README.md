# High Contrast Extended

This resource pack is an extension of the high contrast pack that mojang has started to include in snapshots 
This pack extends the high contrast to all GUIs as of 1.19.4-pre-2

Note: Dark blocks may be hard to see, I tried to mitigate this by making the actual inventory slots slightly lighter than the surrounding area, but if anyone else has a better way to handle this, feel free to PR it lol

Thank you to the Minecraft Commands Discord for helping me with the text stuff lol
